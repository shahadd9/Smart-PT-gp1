The difference is that, in the chest dip, you lean forward and flare out your elbows, whereas in the triceps dip, you keep your body upright and elbows tucked in. Leaning forward and flaring out your elbows targets your lower pectoralis major, whereas keeping your body upright and elbows tucked in targets your triceps brachii.","To make the chest dip easier, use an assisted dip machine. If you have no access to an assisted dip machine, tie a resistance band to the dip bar and create a loop that you can step in with one foot.

This will allow you to effectively target your lower pectoralis major.,Keep your core and gluteal muscles engaged throughout the exercise and Do not shrug. Your shoulders should stay down during the exercise.,"The machine assists you as you push back up to the starting position by providing a counterweight. Thus, the heavier the weight you use, the easier it will be for you to push yourself back up. Choose a weight heavy enough to assist you, but not too heavy that it will keep your pectoralis major from being challenged.Some models of the assisted dip machine may require you to stand on a platform instead of kneel on a pad. Whether standing or kneeling, the form remains the same—lean forward and flare your elbows out. This will ensure that you target your chest and not your triceps."

By taking out any momentum, you will better isolate, and increase the tension on, the muscles being worked.","The outer (long) head of your biceps brachii is activated more than the inner (short) head is because, at the top of the movement, the inner head develops slack (i.e. enters into active insufficiency). This is true with all preacher curl exercise variations.The reverse preacher curl can also be done using an EZ bar, dumbbells, a barbell, or resistance bands."
29,"Holding a dumbbell in one hand, sit on the preacher bench with the back of your upper arm flat on the arm rest and your elbow flexed.",Rotate your wrist so that your palm faces away from you (pronation).,null,null,"Keeping your wrist pronated, inhale as you lower the dumbbell until your elbow is almost fully extended.  ",Exhale as you bring the dumbbell back up to the starting position by flexing your elbow.,Hold for a count of two and squeeze your biceps.,Repeat steps 1 to 3 for the prescribed number of repetitions then repeat the exercise with your opposite arm.,"To reduce the risk of injuring your elbow, do not lock it out when lowering the dumbbell.","If you do not have access to a preacher bench, you may use an inclined bench by standing behind it and resting the back of your upper arm on the top of the bench. The top of the bench should be under your armpit.","Depending on your grip type and the position of your elbow, the target muscle in elbow-flexion exercises can be either your biceps brachii, brachialis, or brachioradialis. In this exercise, a pronated grip is used, which puts the biceps brachii at a mechanical disadvantage and makes the brachioradialis the target.","You may perform this exercise one arm at a time, as described, or with both arms simultaneously, as in the dumbbell reverse preacher curl."
30,"Stand holding an EZ-curl bar using a close supinated grip (hands closer than shoulder width apart and palms facing upward). Your elbows should be almost fully extended, and the bar should be resting against your thighs.",null,null,null,"Keeping your elbows fixed to your sides, exhale as you curl the EZ-curl bar up toward your shoulders.",Hold for a count of two and squeeze your biceps.,Inhale as you lower the EZ-curl bar to the starting position.,Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.,"Your biceps brachii has two heads: short (inner) and long (outer). The long head makes up the majority of the biceps’ peak, whereas the short head sits on the inner side and contributes to the biceps’ width. The close-grip EZ bar curl will emphasize the long head and build the peak of your biceps. The wide-grip EZ bar curl will emphasize the short head and give your biceps more width. The standard (shoulder-width) EZ bar curl will place approximately equal emphasis on both heads.","An easy way to remember whether you’re working the short/inner or long/outer head of the biceps brachii is to look in the mirror. When using a close grip, which, as explained above, targets the long head, the long head will be visible. When using a wide grip, which targets the short head, the short head will be visible.",Keep your elbows locked to your sides and your body still. Only your forearms should move.,"Using the EZ-curl bar instead of a standard barbell to do biceps curls reduces the pressure on your wrists. However, the camber (bend) of the EZ-curl bar must be minimal. The steeper the camber, the more emphasis you will place on your brachioradialis instead of your biceps brachii. Therefore, if a standard barbell doesn’t hurt your wrists, use that instead of the EZ-curl bar."
31,Place a bench under a high cable pulley.,Lie on the bench so that your face is positioned under the straight bar.,Grasp the bar using a shoulder-width supinated (underhand) grip. The cable should be taut and your arms should be almost fully extended.,null,"Keeping your upper arms still and your body flat on the bench, exhale as you curl the bar towards your forehead until your elbows are fully flexed.",Hold for a count of two and squeeze your biceps.,"Inhale as you reverse the movement and return the bar to the starting position, with your arms almost fully extended.",Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.,The point of lying down is to ensure that your body stays still. This prevents cheating and better isolates your elbow flexors.,Keep your upper arms still. Only your forearms should move and keep your elbows in line with your shoulders.,"As with the dumbbell preacher curl, when you perform the lying high cable curl, the long head of your biceps brachii is activated more than is the short head. The reason is that, at the top of the repetition, the short head develops slack (i.e. it enters into active insufficiency).","The straight bar can be hard on some people’s wrists. If that is the case with you, you can use a wavy bar and  lying high cable curl is also known as the supine high cable curl."

However, it can help you to work your biceps in the absence of dumbbells and barbells.","The weight of your torso will be too heavy for your biceps, which is why you also have to flex your waist.","The side-lying biceps bodyweight curl is awkward and requires practice. As you practice, try to minimize waist flexion, emphasize elbow flexion, and get as much range of motion as possible in your elbow.","In the absence of dumbbells and barbells, you can also use the biceps leg curl."
